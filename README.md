# Customer-Review-prediction
A Restaurant company have to know wether the customer is satisfied with their food or not. After finishing their food, they are asking the customers to write a review on the food. Now, they have the review and have to find weather the customer like the food or not. But going through each and every review takes a lot of time. So, by using we will solve the problem by using NLP.

In this, by using a text corpus we can train the model with positive and negative words. And while predicting, 0 means the review is bad and 1 mean the review is good.

Try using Spyder so that the dataset can be visualized properly.
